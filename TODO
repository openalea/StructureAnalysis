TODO list for `StructureAnalysis` to be updated / completed. We target a next official release of the package that must integrate with openalea CI/CD workflow and work on all plateforms.

[ ] Repare `stat_tool` and `sequence_analysis` tests
[ ] Add `stat_tool` and `sequence_analysus` documentation
[ ] Specify and document classes design patterns (e.g. should all wrappers be adaptable to a potential `Rcpp` implementation)
[ ] List prioritary functionalities to be implemented
