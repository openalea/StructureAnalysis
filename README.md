# StructureAnalysis

This package was intended to provide tools for statistical analysis of the structure of a plant.

It is being refactored. Stat_tool has now moved to [https://github.com/openalea/stat_tool](https://github.com/openalea/stat_tool) while sequence_analysis has moved to  [https://github.com/openalea/sequence_analysis](https://github.com/openalea/sequence_analysis).

The other components of StructureAnalysis will be handled later.
