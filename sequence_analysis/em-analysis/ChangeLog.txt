* architecture reworked
* requirements.txt is now generated using a python virtual environment pip freeze > requirements.txt
* ggplot lib is replacing matplotlib and pandas plots
* repo on github: large file deleted
* compiled files have been git ignored for space and speed purposes.

It is now necessary to recompile every module (stat_tools, sequence_analysis or ema) which has changed after pulling. Reminder: python2.7 ema/setup.py develop --user


/!\ There are encoding issues in the new data file. Readmode is coding (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2) instead of (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
And TEXT_NO corresponds is not an identifier for the text but corresponds to the order the text has been displayed.

* eye_movement_data.py
    * includes all the preprocessing
    * can generate a preprocessed xlsx file
    * data preprocessing before approval: preprocessed_data_nov17.xlsx
    * filled missing values using wide 1 hidden layer MLPR with cross-validated regularization
* png_plot.py
    * now works with pandas structures
    * new function: plot_col_scanpath which displays one or several cols as text for each fixation on the scanpath img
    * test_png_plot.py (which is more like an example file atm)
* model.py
    * lightened. Input data is imperatively an eye_movement_data object because of high compatibility issues when passing a seq as input
* oculometric_missing_values_estimation
    * cross-validation on regularization parameter for inria' cluster
